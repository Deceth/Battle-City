HOW TO INSTALL SKINS
--------------------
To use a skin, all you need to do is copy your new images into the main
Battle City folder. Make sure your new images use the same file names as the 
default images! 

Instructions:

1. Open the folder for the skin you would like to use.
2. Select all files in this folder, right click with your mouse, select "Copy".
3. Go back to the main Battle City folder, the one containing BattleCity.exe.
4. Right click an empty space, select "Paste" to copy the files to the main folder.
5. It will ask if you want to replace the existing file. Select YES!

Next time you log onto Battle City, your graphics will be updated!
