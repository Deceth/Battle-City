# Battle City
---

  Battle City is a very fun and addicting online game. You start off by either building a city or applying for a job in a city built by someone else. Your goal is to defend your city while attacking and destroying enemy cities. All of this is done in real-time from the comfort of your tank! For more information, visit the Official Battle City Website.
  The best thing about Battle City is that it has been released under the GPLv3 open source license. This license gives ownership of the game to the community and ensures Battle City will stay free and open source forever!
